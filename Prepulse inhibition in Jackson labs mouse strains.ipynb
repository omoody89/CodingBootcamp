    "# Inhibition of the acoustic startle response as a marker for schizophrenia\n",
    "\n",
    "The [acoustic startle reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startle_response#Acoustic_startle_reflex) (ASR) is as its name implies a specific type of startle reflex triggered by auditory stimuli. It is thought that specific brain pathways mediate the ASR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthy subjects can inhbit the ASR when it is preceded by a \"pre-pulse\" (a weaker stimulus that precedes a stimulus that would cause ASR). This phenomenon is known as pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). Some studies find that prodromal schizophrenic patients show diminished PPI compared to healthy subjects [1,2]. The studies conclude that the impaired PPI results from dysfunction of sensory gating in schizophrenia. It remains unclear what physical changes in the brain give rise to this dysfunctional sensory gating.\n",
